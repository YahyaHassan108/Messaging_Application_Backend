# **Chat Application - Under Development**

## **Overview**

This is a real-time, scalable chat application built with modern technologies. It is designed to provide a seamless messaging experience, supporting real-time communication, room-based organization, and easy message handling. The application is still under development, and this repository contains the current architecture and ongoing features.

The app supports user authentication, room management, message broadcasting, and message history retrieval, with a focus on scalability, performance, and flexibility.

## **Technologies Used**

This project leverages cutting-edge technologies to ensure optimal performance and user experience:

### **Frontend:**
- **Angular:** A robust, well-structured framework used for building dynamic single-page applications. It provides a powerful CLI, two-way data binding, and reusable components.
- **RxJS:** A reactive programming library for managing asynchronous data streams and events in the Angular frontend. It enables efficient handling of real-time updates and complex asynchronous operations.
- **Firebase Authentication:** A backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solution to manage user authentication and provide secure access control to the application. It integrates easily with Angular and provides OAuth authentication.
- **Socket.IO:** Used to implement real-time communication through WebSockets, enabling users to receive instant updates (e.g., new messages, typing indicators) without needing to refresh the page.

### **Backend:**
- **Node.js:** The backend is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows us to build scalable and fast network applications. It runs asynchronously, making it perfect for handling multiple simultaneous connections in real time.
- **Express.js:** A lightweight framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of web APIs. It handles HTTP requests, routing, and middlewares, providing an easy setup for RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections.
- **Firebase Firestore:** A cloud-hosted NoSQL database to store application data. Firestore is used to store messages, rooms, user profiles, and other relevant data in a highly scalable and real-time manner.
- **Socket.IO (Backend):** The backend uses Socket.IO to create real-time communication channels between the client and server. This is essential for broadcasting messages, notifying users, and updating room statuses.

### **Deployment:**
- **Firebase Hosting:** For fast and secure hosting of the Angular frontend application, Firebase Hosting provides a scalable, reliable, and easy-to-manage environment for deploying web applications.
- **Docker (Optional for Local Development):** Docker is used to containerize the backend, ensuring a consistent development environment and simplifying deployment across different systems.

## **Features**

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration through Firebase Authentication.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Socket.IO integration to provide real-time messaging and notifications.
- **Room Management:** Create, join, and leave rooms with ease. Manage room metadata such as room names, members, and last messages.
- **Message History:** Retrieve message histories per room, with real-time updates as new messages are sent.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Optimized to handle many users and rooms with minimal performance impact. Real-time updates and asynchronous operations are handled efficiently.
- **Future Enhancements:** Features like message statuses, typing indicators, and multimedia support are planned for future releases.

## **Future Improvements**

This project is still under development, and several exciting features are planned, including:

- **Message Status Tracking**: Track the delivery and read status of messages for more interactive experiences.
- **File Sharing**: Allow users to send and receive multimedia files (images, documents, etc.) within rooms.
- **User Profiles**: Extend the user profile to support rich information (e.g., avatar, bio, preferences).
- **Typing Indicators**: Show when a user is typing a message in a room.
